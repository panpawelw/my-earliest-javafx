Workshop_1 revisited. The same games and apps done using more advanced programming concepts and JavaFX 8 user interface.
Regular expressions, lambdas and streams can be found here and there.

- Guessing numbers #1 - user has to guess a number randomly generated by the program.

- Lottery - pick 6 lottery numbers and let's see if they match numbers drawn by the program.

- Guessing numbers #2 - this program will guess a number chosen by you in 10 steps or less.

- Dice - dice roll simulator. Enter an expression describing how many dice of what type with optional modifier.
		 You can also select all parameters using JavaFX Scene Builder generated UI. Separate controller and FXML file.

- Most popular words - scan chosen websites using jsoup, save a list of all words in headlines to a file,
                       make a list of 10 most frequent words for every website and in general. You will also get
                       a nice pie chart and list of words for each website in tabbed UI. Separate controller and FMXL file.
